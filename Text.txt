I created a project called EntertainmentCatalog in Eclipse and synced it with the EntertainmentRepository2. 
It has been declared as a Spring Starter Project. 
I gave it Lombok, mySQL Driver, Spring Boot DevTools, Spring Data JPA, Spring Web, and Tymeleaf dependencies.
If I've made an oversight in creating the project, I might have to start over.
